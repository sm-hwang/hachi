# DNA-Storage-Simulation

This was a Summer research project funded by the PURE Award from the University of Calgary. The program attempts to simulate the molecular processes of synthesis, polymerase chain reaction, and sequencing of a pool of oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotides are encoded and output decoded by DNA Fountain (https://github.com/TeamErlich/dna-fountain). It was built to attempt to explore whether synthetic nucleotides, more specifically P and Z nucleotides from Steven Benner's group, was viable for DNA data storage.
