# Hachi

This was a summer research project funded by the PURE Award from the University of Calgary. The program attempts to simulate the molecular processes of synthesis, amplification (by PCR), and sequencing of a pool of oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotides are encoded and output decoded by DNA Fountain (https://github.com/TeamErlich/dna-fountain). It was built in an attempt to explore whether synthetic nucleotides, more specifically P and Z nucleotides from Steven Benner's group, was viable for DNA data storage.
